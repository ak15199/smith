## Beginning DevOps

Here's a sample page created with markdown.

This is how you reference other pages:

* [Starting Our Journey](/blog/Starting_Our_Journey.html)
* [Change is Hard](/blog/Change_is_Hard.html)
* [Not Everyone Gets It](/blog/Not_Everyone_Gets_It.html)
* [Where to Start?](/blog/Where_to_Start.html)
* [Keep it Simple](/blog/Keep_it_Simple.html)
* [Show Me the DevOps Money](/blog/Show_Me_the_DevOps_Money.html)

These pages were created by the medium importer, and so there's
some extra decoration to them. But they are still markdown that
works with this software.
